## **About Me**
My name is Dmitryi, I am 32. Now Iâ€™m at the beginning stage of frontend developer adventure. Every job I do is usually done successfully thanks to my responsibility, motivation/dedication and diligence. My goal is  discovering new, constant self-development and sharing of knowledge and skills with others. I like to meet the challenge using my analytical abilities. At my former place of work I learned how to work in stressful situations/conditions and do not fear to make decision. High organisational and interpersonal skills, punctuality and honesty have been the basis of my upbringing. I am sure that thanks to positive attitude and a good sense of humor, you can make this world a better place!
